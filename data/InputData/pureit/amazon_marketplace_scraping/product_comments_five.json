I also told them that water is available only between 10 am to 12 am so they will have to send their technician between that time. They noted my requirements and informed me that the technician will be calling me before coming. I received a call from the technician on the same day and he confirmed that he will be coming on 8th May by 10-10:30 am. He came during the specified time, installed and checked the machine. He explained me the functionality also. But later, I found that there is a drop-by-drop leakage from the bottom. I again called the company and booked my complaint with the same Sunday conditions. The technician came on 15th May at 10 am and did the necessary and the leakage stopped. Later he told me that he is an engineer. He also told me that their plumber was on leave on the day of installation, so he came himself. Such a dedication that an engineer is coming himself for the installation. I haven't seen this anywhere. The company that is doing Pureit installations in Pune is Iqra Enterprises and the name of engineer who came is Yogesh Sakpal. Hats off to both. I have given 4 ratings currently just because it is new. Let me use it for a month or two, then I will come and edit my rating.

This is the worst purchase I have made on Amazon. During installation, the technician will not wait to check the water quality. He will also force you to provide 5 star rating in front of him and when asked for the reason, he will tell you that this is company policy. When complained about this, the company representative will say that there is no such policy but no action will be taken and innocent customers will keep providing 5 star rating to this useless product under pressure. The RO broke down within 11 months and when technician visited on complaint, he told the membrane has to be replaced without even opening the RO at all (he must have some great powers that we don't know about). Even under warranty, they will charge full cost of repair to you. At this point, we gave up and will buy RO from another company. Writing this review so other people can save their money.
