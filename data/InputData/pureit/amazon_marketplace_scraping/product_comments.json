I also told them that water is available only between 10 am to 12 am so they will have to send their technician between that time. They noted my requirements and informed me that the technician will be calling me before coming. I received a call from the technician on the same day and he confirmed that he will be coming on 8th May by 10-10:30 am. He came during the specified time, installed and checked the machine. He explained me the functionality also. But later, I found that there is a drop-by-drop leakage from the bottom. I again called the company and booked my complaint with the same Sunday conditions. The technician came on 15th May at 10 am and did the necessary and the leakage stopped. Later he told me that he is an engineer. He also told me that their plumber was on leave on the day of installation, so he came himself. Such a dedication that an engineer is coming himself for the installation. I haven't seen this anywhere. The company that is doing Pureit installations in Pune is Iqra Enterprises and the name of engineer who came is Yogesh Sakpal. Hats off to both. I have given 4 ratings currently just because it is new. Let me use it for a month or two, then I will come and edit my rating.

This is the worst purchase I have made on Amazon. During installation, the technician will not wait to check the water quality. He will also force you to provide 5 star rating in front of him and when asked for the reason, he will tell you that this is company policy. When complained about this, the company representative will say that there is no such policy but no action will be taken and innocent customers will keep providing 5 star rating to this useless product under pressure. The RO broke down within 11 months and when technician visited on complaint, he told the membrane has to be replaced without even opening the RO at all (he must have some great powers that we don't know about). Even under warranty, they will charge full cost of repair to you. At this point, we gave up and will buy RO from another company. Writing this review so other people can save their money.

When I called the sales head, he told that it would go minimum 3-4 year in all parts of bangalore. There was no support from customer care apart from a standard reply that we have escalated this matter. Then they said there is no warranty on resign.  After 1 month , they closed the request giving the reason that it is unserviceable.  This is a garbage product. While selling, they would call 100 times with false promises of 5-6 years of zero maintenance and then they close the request if you don't spend 11k every year.  This product cost 80000 rupees. So if you are buyign this, think twice. You will spend 80k for one year and then 10k every year.","helpful":null}]}

Purchased it last year, every month there is some issue with this RO despite good water inlet ( TDS ~ l500, clean) and voltage. Issues - Frequent waste water stopages , motor running continuosly but not filling storage tank. Had to change GKK twice. Already spent  70% of the purchase cost in very first year. My uses are decent for a small family of 4 members. Worst part is, only electrical part is covered under warranty and they don't take any responsibility of poor quality GKK kit that they are supplying at exorbitant prices. Prior to this I was using Puriet ULTIMA, it ran good for 6 years. Seems overall quality of Puriet products and spares has gone down. Thinking to switch to another brand now.","helpful":null}]}

We tried to save money initially as we were told the maintenance cost for Kent is high, but the other brand purifier did not help it was told RO but it dint change the taste. So we thought of giving kent a try and it was our best decision. The technician came installed explained and set tds to proper level to help us get good taste water and we are happy. It throws out waste water but we use it to wash urensils. They have free servicing for few years which is not bad. The cheaper purifiers might be less but their life is also small.

They will insist you to buy annual maintenance contract worth of 3300 (which will cover the UF filter cost , but pump cost is separate). Their warranty is useless and will not cover anything.

The installation guy would convience you to spend extra money for seperate filter. Even when you insist they will not test the water TDS level and would ask you to book a service only for that. When I did that we found that the TDS level is same in the outlet & inlet. The purifier is not filtering at all. When raising the complaint again, one of the candles has been replaced by the technician, the service took 3 days as the technician couldn't find the problem initially. After two days, the purifier stopped again as the water is not filling up in the tank. This is worst experience & I suggest not to buy this product on Amazon as Eureka Forbes make it exclusively for Amazon which is inferior quality compared to regular ones.

Used EF other model for 6 years before buying this one. Delivery was quick. But installation took one week. When you buy this RO, buy a prefilter of your own which cost ₹300 whereas the EF technician will ask ₹1000/-.

It was very easy to install. The Kent installation guy was trying to sell another filter for 600 bucks but I strongly declined as it is almost useless. Kent needs to work a lot on that. If I am buying a filter already why would I buy another one and if it's necessary why they didn't include it in the package. Coming to the filter, it is only Ultraviolet and Ultra filtration system which is suitable for Municipal supplied water which is my case. The water comes out very pure and I enjoy drinking it.
