Now we waited for 2 days since we got an update that you will receive a a message containing details of oppointment time we did not receive any we call Amazon they say it has to be done from brand . 1st time We called up the whirlpool service support they said we have registered the complaint you get detail of installation in 2-3 hours. I did not receive any message so I called the service support 2nd time ,next day and to my surprise I got an update that there is no record of any complaint linked to the number I Sadi how come I kept calm and ask them to created another ticket . Waited for full day I did not receive any message call the support center again and heard the same response 'sir no complaint registered from your number' I did not keep the calm I said I don want any installation (it was already 4 days ) i was expecting atleast confirmation that they will assign anyone to install the product be it 3 Rd 4th or 5 th but this did not happened. I call the Amazon help desk and ask them to take the return they denied saying since it's just an installation issue but then I said if this doesn't not get resolved i will take it social media platform finally they agreed to take the return. Now i am returning the product just because of poor sevice of whirlpool. So think before investing if the initial service is poor how would it be after sale service .

Have been using whirlpool washing machines since the last 2 decades or more and hence had great expectations from this one as well. Although the look and feel of the product is nice, it fails on the most basic need and thats washing without human intervention. Till now, have not been able to figure out whats the 360 wash function. The washing does not come close to how the previous machines with agitators used work. The biggest flaw however is the how the machine sometimes vibrates and physically moves violently during rinsing and drying cycle. This is due to the load not being balanced correctly by the machine. No matter how you arrange the clothes initially in the tub before the wash, the clothes get rearranged during the washing cycle and if its not balanced correctly then, get ready for the most annoying and violent sound  you have ever heard from a washing machine. The machine literally starts moving around and you have to stop the machine, rearrange the clothes and then resume. Due to this, one has to be always present when washing clothes in this machine. So I would not say this is fully automatic. I have faced this issue 4 out of 10 times when using the machine. Really miss the previous washing machine where I could just forget after putting in the clothes.","helpful":null},{"username":"Gaurav goyal","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Best Washing Machine, Value for Money","country":"India","date":"2022-04-10 00:00:00","design":null,"verified":"Verified Purchase","description":"This was the online washing machine which has inbuilt heater and inverter.

Within 2 hours of Delivery, Haier team got in touch an in next few hours they came to install and demonstrated the features very nicely. This is the most silent machine we had so far. Very less vibration too. Wash quality is good and washes quickly and efficiently with less water compared to others we had used. If you have a budget of around 25k this is the best machine.
