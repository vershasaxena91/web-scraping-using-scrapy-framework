When the exposed dentine comes in contact with hot, cold, sweet or sour food and drinks, it can trigger a sharp short sensation called tooth sensitivity. Sensodyne Repair & Protect is a daily fluoride toothpaste that helps to repair and protect the sensitive areas of teeth, while still providing the benefits of a regular paste like strong teeth and health gums. The paste is powered by Novamin, a unique calcium formulation that helps to repair sensitive areas with the natural building blocks of teeth. The paste also builds ongoing protection with every brush so that you can enjoy your favorite foods and drinks without the worry of sensitive teeth. Sensodyne Repair & Protect Deep Repair tooth paste is available in three packs - 70 gm, 100 gm and 140 gm (70 gm * 2) combo pack. Brushing twice a day provides protection from tooth sensitivity.

Other parts of the mouth like tongue, gums, palette (roof of the mouth) and inner side of the cheeks may not get cleaned. This may lead to germ build up in the mouth which causes various oral problems like bad breath, bleeding gums and cavities.Rinsing everyday with Listerine removes 99.9% germs from your mouth as it can reach every corner of your mouth.

When the exposed dentine comes in contact with hot, cold, sweet or sour food and drinks, it can trigger a sharp short sensation called tooth sensitivity. Sensodyne Deep Clean is a daily fluoride toothpaste that helps protect against tooth sensitivity, while still providing the benefits of a regular paste like strong teeth and health gums.

If the problem is not addressed in time, it may result in decay of teeth right from root, develops foul smell from mouth and contracts similar disorders to neighbouring teeth. In such condition, a soothing but effective cure that can be applied within mouth is needed unlike applications used to relieve muscular pain which contain non-edible ingredients. Hence, Anju Tooth Drop proves to be a really useful and effective medicine that doesn’t have any side effect. It can be used by a person of any age. Anju Tooth Drop contains extremely beneficial ingredients, like: Laung (Clove): Clove oil is known for its antimicrobial, antifungal, antiseptic and antiviral properties. Its properties as a germicidal agent makes it useful to relieve dental pain, bleeding gums and ulcers. Ajwain (Carom Seeds): Helpful in maintaining Oral hygiene. Neelgiri (Eucalyptus): Helps as disinfectant and removes mouth odour. Also, it helps in strengthening gums and has microbial properties. Kapoor (Camphor): Helps in reducing inflammation/sensation in tooth. All these items are edible in nature and find their wide application in Indian kitchen. Hence, when taken for medicinal use, they neither cause any side effect nor disturb the taste but, stop the pain immediately and also help in curing the causes of pain.

Promote healthy gums and teeth using this air powered hydro floss water pick. Benefits Helps clean between teeth and other hard-to-reach places Removes food particles Helps reduce the depth of gingival sulcus Massages and strengthens gums. No batteries, cord, or charging station is required. Irrigating teeth is less abrasive that using tooth floss on your gums. You can also add a little mouthwash into the jet for a cleaner feeling. Using air technology that's propels the water, power floss blasts away food debris that is on and in between your teeth. Hydro floss easily reaches the back of your teeth due to its low profile tip.

When the exposed dentine comes in contact with hot, cold, sweet or sour food and drinks, it can trigger a sharp short sensation called tooth sensitivity. Sensodyne Repair & Protect is a daily fluoride toothpaste that helps to repair and protect the sensitive areas of teeth, while still providing the benefits of a regular paste like strong teeth and health gums. The paste is powered by Novamin, a unique calcium formulation that helps to repair sensitive areas with the natural building blocks of teeth.

When the protective layer of teeth (enamel) is worn away or gums recede, the dentine underneath becomes exposed. When the exposed dentine comes in contact with hot, cold, sweet or sour food and drinks, it can trigger a sharp short sensation called tooth sensitivity. Meanwhile, Gum problems are caused by a build-up of plaque bacteria. Sensodyne Sensitivity & Gum is a daily fluoride toothpaste that helps protect against tooth sensitivity and improves gum health, while still providing the benefits of a regular paste.

It also helps restore the natural whiteness of your teeth by removing stains and leaving you with a whiter smile. With twice daily brushing, you can enjoy your favorite foods and drinks without the worry of sensitive teeth. Sensodyne Whitening tooth paste is available in a 70 gm pack. Always follow instructions and guidance included on the pack before use.","product_details":{"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer                                                                                                                ":"No","Product Dimensions                                                                                                                ":"3 x 3.4 x 14.8 cm; 80 Grams","Date First Available                                                                                                                ":"1 January 2017","Manufacturer                                                                                                                ":"GSK Consumer Healthcare Limited","ASIN                                                                                                                ":"B01F3E7KOG","Item model number                                                                                                                ":"8901571008186","Country of Origin                                                                                                                ":"India","Item Weight                                                                                                                ":"80 g","Item Dimensions LxWxH                                                                                                                ":"30 x 34 x 148 Millimeters","Net Quantity                                                                                                                ":"70.0 gram","Best Sellers Rank":"#104 in Health & Personal Care  (See Top 100 in Health & Personal Care) #4 in Toothpastes #27 in Personal Care (Health & Personal Care)","Customer Reviews":"4.5 out of 5 stars 10,712 ratings"},"product_fullfilled":"Fulfilled","product_icons":["Pay on Delivery","Not Returnable","Amazon Delivered","No-Contact Delivery"],"product_important_information":"NA","product_name":"Sensodyne Toothpaste Whitening, Sensitive tooth paste to restore natural whiteness, 70 gm","product_offers":"NA","product_original_price":"135.00","product_rating":"4.5 out of 5 stars","product_sale_price":"134.00","product_subscription_discount":"1%","product_total_reviews":"10,712 ratings","product_variations":[]}

Other parts of the mouth like tongue, gums, palette (roof of the mouth) and inner side of the cheeks may not get cleaned.
