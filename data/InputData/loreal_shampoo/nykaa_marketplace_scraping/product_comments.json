Low porosity hair needs clarifying shampoo which is free from proteins, keratin, heavy ingredients, this one is free from those and hence a deep conditioning as a pre poo and use this shampoo for satisfactory results. Note: the formula has changed a bit now, 2nd ingredient is SLES instead of SLS so, it reduced its stripping power just a bit in terms of clarifying you can test it in comparison with pantene lively clean which has SLS as 2nd ingredient but it has rice water hence can only be used once or twice a month as it dries out low porosity hair due to film forming build up.","likes":0},{"username":"Ethel Tungoe","rating":5,"title":"Head and shoulders smooth and shiny shampoo.","date":"2022-07-12 12:58:43","description":"Very nice .
