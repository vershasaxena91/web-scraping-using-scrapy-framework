However, the brand does not claim for this product to either reduce, reverse or stop the condition of hairfall in any manner. \n\nQuick tip: The primary job of a shampoo is to cleanse your hair and eliminate dirt, grime and impurities from your hair and scalp. Products like hair oil, hair mask and other treatments that stay on your hair and scalp long enough for visible results are capable of introducing considerable changes to your hair concerns. Shampoos that fall under the category of anti-hairfall are formulated to not completely treat the situation, but to lessen the hair fall caused by harsh sulfate and paraben inclusive hair cleansers. Here at Nykaa, we look after all your needs and bring to you problem specific products at your doorstep.
