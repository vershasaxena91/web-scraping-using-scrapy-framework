Introducing Nutribarn Zero Calorie Sweetener, made with Erythritol and Sucralose. Simple carbohydrates like sugar cause Glucose spikes and insulin resistance leading to lifestyle diseases like diabetes, hypertension, gout etc. Cutting sugar is the first step towards a healthy lifestyle for you and your family. Nutribarn Zero Calorie Sweetener is ideal for use in any application that sugar is used in. Nutribarn Zero Calorie Sweetener is 4 times sweeter than regular sugar - this means 1 teaspoon of Nutribarn Zero Calorie Sweetener is equal to 4 teaspoons of regular sugar. You can substitute sugar in any recipe using this ratio. For example if a recipe calls for 40 grams or 10 teaspoons of sugar, you can divide that by 4 and replace the regular sugar with 10 grams or 2½ teaspoon Nutribarn Zero Calorie Sweetener. Nutribarn Zero Calorie Sweetener is taste-identical with regular sugar, so you’ll hardly even notice that it’s there. Nutribarn Zero Calorie Sweetener is also heat stable, so it does not degrade at high temperatures unlike other low-quality cheap sweeteners. Nutribarn Zero Calorie Sweetener is truly zero calories, many sweeteners - though labelled sugar-free - still have calories and sub-standard additives such as xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol, maltodextrin etc. Nutribarn Zero Calorie Sweetener is made with only 2 ingredients - Erythritol (which is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol) and less than 1% of Sucralose.","product_details":{"Specialty":"Zero Calorie sweetener","Ingredient Type":"Low Carb","Brand":"NUTRIBARN","Form":"Powder","Serving Recommendation":"Replace regular sugar in 1:4 ratio","Manufacturer":"Healthy Monkey LLP, For any information or concern please email hello@healthymonkey.in","Item part number":"N9013_0","Net Quantity":"450.0 gram","Product Dimensions":"10 x 10 x 12 cm; 450 Grams","Ingredients":"Sucralose, Erythritol","Serving Size":"1 Grams","Energy (kcal)":"0 \tKilocalories","Protein":"0 Grams","Fat":"0 Grams","Carbohydrate":"0 Grams","- Sugars":"0 Grams","Country of Origin":"India","ASIN":"B0B2LWNZFN","Date First Available":"27 May 2022","Item Weight":"450 g","Item Dimensions LxWxH":"10 x 10 x 12 Centimeters","Generic Name":"Zero Calorie Sweetener","Best Sellers Rank":"#246,313 in Grocery & Gourmet Foods  (See Top 100 in Grocery & Gourmet Foods) #1,452 in Sugar Substitutes"},"product_fullfilled":"NA","product_icons":["Non-Returnable","Amazon Delivered","No-Contact Delivery"],"product_important_information":"Erythritol.

While the former is of no use when you’re hungry, a cup of Epigamia Greek yogurt is just perfect. Epigamia was the term used for marriage between two city states in ancient Greece. We have adapted this word to talk about our celebration of the marriage of health and taste in our products; healthy preservative free snacks that help you find your happy balance! Our journey started with us wanting to contemporise tradition by creating innovative items that have classic ingredients with modern twists thrown in. We wanted to push boundaries to create something new but familiar. Our Greek yogurt is an example of this. It has all the healthy goodness of homemade dahi, with the added punch of high protein and zero preservatives. Taking forward this love we have for innovation, we daresay we’ve done it again! Introducing the first no added sugar Greek yogurt in India. Made with real ingredients and no preservatives, this strawberry yogurt brings together the classic pairing of strawberries and cream, with ripe strawberries and thick yogurt creating a timeless combination. Zero preservatives, high protein, real fruit content and no added sugar make this a great snack to beat the everyday hunger pangs. Give it a try and tell us what you think!.","product_details":{"Cuisine":"Greek","Specialty":"Weight Watcher, No Added Sugar, No Preservatives","Weight":"120 Grams","Ingredient Type":"Vegetarian","Brand":"Epigamia","Storage Instructions":"Store between 4 to 8 degrees celsius","Item Package Quantity":"1","Manufacturer":"Drums Food, 18002663746","Allergen Information":"Gluten Free","Item part number":"8906059636257","Net Quantity":"120.0 gram","Product Dimensions":"6.4 x 6.4 x 3.8 cm; 120 Grams","Ingredients":"Greek yogurt (pasteurized double toned milk, milk solids, stabilizing agent (pectin INS 440),permitted starter cultures),  processed strawberry pulp (Strawberry Puree , De-ionized Apple , Water, Steviol glycosides (INS 960), Salt, Lemon Juice Concentrate)","ASIN":"B081RVX4PK","Date First Available":"19 November 2019","Item Weight":"120 g","Item Dimensions LxWxH":"6.4 x 6.4 x 3.8 Centimeters","Generic Name":"Greek Yogurt Strawberry- No Added Sugar","Customer Reviews":"4.4 out of 5 stars 939 ratings"},"product_fullfilled":"NA","product_icons":["Returns Policy","Amazon Delivered","No-Contact Delivery"],"product_important_information":"Greek yogurt (pasteurized double toned milk, milk solids, stabilizing agent (pectin INS 440),permitted starter cultures),  processed strawberry pulp (Strawberry Puree , De-ionized Apple , Water, Steviol glycosides (INS 960), Salt, Lemon Juice Concentrate)Eat on the goActual product packaging and materials may contain more and/or different information than that shown on our web site.

Harvesters tap coconut palm sap by cutting into the trees flower bud stem to access its nectar. The palm liquid sap is then collected into containers. This sap is placed under heat and boiled until the water gets evaporated and only raw coconut sugar remains. Coconut sugar is a popular sweetener in many vegan diets, as it is plant-based and minimally processed. Because of its properties, it is considered a better sweetener with a lower glycemic index. Here are some astounding health benefits of coconut sugar: 1. Prevents low blood sugar: the body relies on glucose for energy. Coconut sugar can help raise blood glucose levels and prevent conditions such as low blood sugar or hyperglycemia. 2. Lower chances of blood sugar spike: coconut sugar contains a small amount of inulin, a soluble fibre that can make post-meal blood sugar spikes less likely. Foods containing inulin can be a healthy choice for people with diabetes. 3. Electrolytes: it contains potassium, magnesium, and sodium, which are essential for regulating our bodies water content and many heart, nerve and muscle functions. 4. Raw antioxidants: since coconut sugar is just dehydrated coconut sap, it is considered a raw food. It retains the rich antioxidants found in the source. Antioxidants fight the oxidation of cells in the body, which helps combat ageing. However, even if coconut sugar is a tidbit healthy, it must still be consumed in moderation to maintain overall good health. Our coconut sugar is unrefined and minimally processed to keep its nutrients intact.","product_details":{"Cuisine":"Indian","Specialty":"Vegetarian","Weight":"300 Grams","Ingredient Type":"Vegetarian","Brand":"Praakritik","Form":"Fresh","Package Information":"Jar","Manufacturer":"Praakritik","Item part number":"PRAAKRITIK-G47","Net Quantity":"1.00 count","Product Dimensions":"13 x 6 x 20 cm; 300 Grams","Ingredients":"Coconut Sugar","ASIN":"B08QCGDH71","Date First Available":"11 December 2020","Item Weight":"300 g","Item Dimensions LxWxH":"13 x 6 x 20 Centimeters","Generic Name":"Coconut Sugar","Customer Reviews":"4.2 out of 5 stars 14 ratings","Best Sellers Rank":"#20,750 in Grocery & Gourmet Foods  (See Top 100 in Grocery & Gourmet Foods) #15 in Coconut Sugar #825 in Grocery"},"product_fullfilled":"NA","product_icons":["Non-Returnable","Amazon Delivered","No-Contact Delivery"],"product_important_information":"Coconut SugarActual product packaging and materials may contain more and/or different information than that shown on our web site.

There are 150 species of Stevia, all native to North and South America. However, stevia is now produced in many countries. The plant can often be purchased at garden centers for home growing. As stevia is 200 to 300 times sweeter than table sugar. BENEFITS- High in Nutrients and Antioxidants May Reduce Cholesterol May Aid in Blood sugar level Help Promote Weight Loss Easy to Add to Your Diet H0W TO USE- Use fresh stevia leaves as a sweetener in beverages, such as tea and lemonade, or in sauces. A few fresh stevia and mint leaves make a refreshing herbal tea when steeped in a cup of boiling water. Add fresh stevia leaves to beverages or foods as a sweet, edible garnish. Although the fresh leaves are less sweet than dried leaves, they're still much sweeter than sugar. Taste-test your beverage before serving to ensure you don't over-sweeten your drink. Use dry stevia leaves to make a powdered sweetener. Bundle and hang fresh stevia plant stems upside down in a warm, dry location until the leaves are thoroughly dry, then strip the leaves from the stems. Fill a blender, food processor or coffee grinder to half full with dry leaves and process at high speed for a few seconds. Store the powdered sweetener in an airtight container. Use the powder in recipes that call for a sweetener, but make adjustments in the amount used due to its dense sweetness.

Made from the leaves of the stevia rebaudiana plant, organic Stevia is 200 to 300 times sweeter than table sugar and has no bitter aftertaste. Just one sachet/ measuring spoon of ORGANIC INDIA Stevia equals 2 tsp of processed sugar. With zero calories, a zero glycemic index, and zero side effects, stevia does not raise your blood sugar levels– making it a healthy sugar alternative for diabetics, weight watchers, and health enthusiasts. Belonging to the Chrysanthemum Family, stevia has been widely used as a sweetener since ancient times.
