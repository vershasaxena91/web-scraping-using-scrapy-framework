Lavender also works to ease motion-sickness and anxieties. This formula is completely natural and includes cold-pressed coconut oil which is excellent for the skin and coat. This massage oil has been effective as a home remedy for hot spots – just dab a few drops and gently massage into the area. Please note: Lavender oil is diluted with coconut oil to make it safe for dogs. However, it is always a good idea to introduce new products slowly to your pet. If you’re not sure if your pet is allergic to lavender oil, just apply a tiny bit on a small spot. Assess the skin’s reaction in a bit and gradually increase the amount you use. Directions for Use: To use as a massage oil: Use as much as required for the whole body. Let it sit for 30-45 minutes before your pet’s bath. To use as a home remedy for hotspots: Add a few drops on to the area and gently massage into the skin.","product_details":{"Manufacturer":"Heads Up For Tails, Packed and Marketed by: Barkyard Private Limited, No.31 First Floor at K.R.

Protect your intimate area with daily use of a liquid intimate wash for women – VWash Plus. With a pH of 3.5, VWash plus restores the pH balance in the intimate area and helps prevent irritation, itching, and dryness. The intimate area has a natural protective layer which is acidic in nature, to help prevent infection. This layer is maintained when good bacteria called lactobacilli produce Lactic acid, which maintains the acidic environment at a pH value of 3.5 to 4.5. This promotes the growth of lactobacilli, inhibiting the presence of harmful bacteria and preventing infection. A healthy vaginal flora requires a pH of 3.5 - 4.5.  VWash Plus- an intimate wash for women has lactic acid which restores vaginal pH balance whereas Most soaps have a pH value of 8 & above. The daily use of soap to cleanse the vaginal area may upset ideal pH balance of the intimate area. This may lead to vaginal discomforts like dryness, irritation & itching and could eventually lead to vaginal infections. VWash plus is an intimate wash for women that helps prevent unpleasant odour & irritation in the intimate area. It is safe for daily use. It has no Paraben & SLS/SLES. VWash Plus is an intimate wash for women usable during periods and pregnancy as well.
