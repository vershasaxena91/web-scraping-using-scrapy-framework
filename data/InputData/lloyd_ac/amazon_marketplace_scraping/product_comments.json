Installation service was horrible. Later on I got it installed from a local guy. Then E5 error was noticed. They said outdoor unit is defective. I started contacting service engineers and customer services but everything was useless. It’s a great pain if you get an ac installed and not working. With a great goggling I thought of initiating through Amazon refund policy. Amazon Representatives asked me to contact service engineer, who was never approachable. Amazon representative asked me for Job Sheet of ac installation which I did not have as it was not installed by Lloyd service engineer. These all happened on 19,04.2022. When customer support did not agree for return and refund they said they will send Amazon service engineer on 22.04.2022 to verify that E5 error exists and outdoor unit is defective. That engineer did not visit the site, but asked the image of the error. Once I complained the same to Amazon  24.04.2022 was fixed to get it verified. Thanks GOD it was updated by Amazon that  they will get it collected. 26,04.2022 was fixed for collecting and it’s done now. How easy it is to get Lloyd ac installed.

Then after that i have felt that my ac not cooling i have called their customer service for that they didn't reply. I have filed written complaint to them and they didn't revert back. After that they answerd my call and gave staff number and i have called them she told me that they receive 600 up calls from customer and this is our rush hour then i said this is your problem if you face this problem in every summer why dont you take out some solution for that. Then i said some guest are going to visit us soon so that why i want you to come urgently then she said i will allot the technician he will visit you Tomorrow.

I have asked them how many it will take because some guest will visit us soon they told us it will take some time like that i have waited after 13 days they came and installed small fan in it and i have asked them to check if there any problem or not then they checked it and said all okay. Then after that i have felt that my ac not cooling i have called their customer service for that they didn't reply. I have filed written complaint to them and they didn't revert back. After that they answerd my call and gave staff number and i have called them she told me that they receive 600 up calls from customer and this is our rush hour then i said this is your problem if you face this problem in every summer why dont you take out some solution for that.

Initially I have to struggle for almost 4 days for installation. During installation technician installed it wrong and due to which my AC blower started making noise. When I complained about it technicians were not accepting their fault and saying its normal noise.

Upon informing amazon regarding this, only Rs.2250 is being reimbursed.","helpful":null},{"username":"srujana kandula","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Pathetic Customer Service and Horrible Product","country":"India","date":"2022-05-17 00:00:00","design":"Color: White","verified":null,"description":"This is the most disgusting product I have ever purchased, The Customer service is pathetic, if they don't know how to resolve the issue then they ignore your calls.","helpful":null},{"username":"Sudhir Dahiya","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"I would say and i will to everyone who is looking for good AC. 👌👌👌👌","country":"India","date":"2022-05-17 00:00:00","design":"Color: White","verified":"Verified Purchase","description":"I m using this product for my coffee shop and seriously it's working amazingly.

We raised a service request and the ticket was forwarded to Panasonic Service Agency (SRI NIKHIL DIGITAL SERVICES - Sanyo Service Center K.v.rangareddy, Telangana) and Spoke to *Mr. Gangadhar Reddy* (most annoying person ever he even abused us multiple times), he sent a technician and they told us that the outer unit isn't working, there is a GAS LEAKAGE. Technician even told me that they are receiving a lot of complaints regarding such issues. Technician visited again and did the welding work inside the outdoor unit for which he has to dismantle the entire outdoor unit. After he completed the work, technician asked us to TURN ON the AC. The moment we switched ON the AC the master MCB got tripped and the technician kept repeating the same thing again and again. As a result of which the Master MCB got tripped *THRICE*. Technician told me because of this tripping issue (some wrong wiring connection from his end) the indoor to outdoor wire might has blasted and his manager *(Gangadhar Reddy) called me and asked to pay ₹1500-2000* to change the wiring. He wanted us to pay this amount without any reason. He was extremely rude and clearly said they can't do anything about it. *Infact, he even closed the service request without our consent. We raised another service request as the issue was not resolved but *Gangadhar Reddy* *again closed the second ticket.* We are now struggling to get this AC replaced. Such a horrible experience. We usually buy Voltas AC. This was the first time we tried Panasonic and it was such a huge mistake.","helpful":null},{"username":"varun","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","title":"DONOT BUY-Just after 1.3 yrs the coil is leaking and Service charges are 10k which is 1/3 AC cost","country":"India","date":"2022-05-11 00:00:00","design":"Color: White","verified":"Verified Purchase","description":"I bought this AC in Feb-2021. Just after 1.3 yrs it stopped cooling - when called up Panasonic service the technician confirmed the coil in outdoor unit is leaking. This coil is inside the outdoor unit box and no one know why it went bad. Panasonic talks about rust proof/corrosion resistant materials but with in such short span the coil went bad and leaking AC gas. Not I have been asked to pay about Rs.10,000 for the new coil and gas filling which is almost 1/3rd of total AC cost that I bought. Believing that Panasonic is Japan based company and has great technology - was a MISTAKE. Pathetic product - even a local made AC would last for couple of yrs w/o any issues. I would suggest - not to buy this and get in to troubles.","helpful":null},{"username":"Hari Reddy ","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Installation issue.. No one coming for installation ..

Waited for whole day carrying my phone wherever I moved in my house but around 5 pm a person from Hitachi customer service called and started blaming me that I was not attending phone and forced me to give back mouthful as the contention was a lie. On third day morning two other technicians called but they arrived after 1 pm. These Hitachi technicians were very horrible as they were leaving out the things which are not in their schedule even it was essential. As I had a fair idea about the nitty gritty of the installation of a c  I had to categorically tell them the things which are essential but not in the installation schedule of Hitachi  should be done even if it costs extra which will be paid. While attaching wires with naked ends at terminals when questioned why the ends naked and not crimped with sockets only to be told that Hitachi don't supply it.

But unfortunately I am not - There is no copper pipe and it costs 850/meter! So I paid extra for the AC itself and on top of that the seller leaves out the copper pipe. Besides that it has been impossible to raise a complaint on Amazon in real-time. The automated options do not help resolve missing item issue. I was left with 2 options: return the item and wait another few weeks for AC or pay for the copper pipe. I went with the latter.

Don't believe the installation charges mentioned on Amazon, that's just the base amount upon which they will add on charges upon charges.","helpful":null},{"username":"Ziaur","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Nice product","country":"India","date":"2022-05-24 00:00:00","design":"Style name: Convertible 6 in 1 + AI + 2022","verified":"Verified Purchase","description":"MY LG AC IS WORKING VERY GOOD THANKS TO AMAZON","helpful":null},{"username":"Shagun Soam","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Worst service ever.","country":"India","date":"2022-05-22 00:00:00","design":"Style name: Convertible 6 in 1 + AI + 2022","verified":"Verified Purchase","description":"Worst service ever.

Fixing the indoor unit, Outdoor stand setup, Connecting with stabilizer and a drill hole during cost me ₹1700. 1500 was fixed installation charges about which I was informed beforehand and 200 for outdoor stand fixing as per the described charges.

AC was installed yesterday and is working fine. Cooling is very good and no noise. The installation cost, especially copper pipe is too expensive. They charged me Rs. 1000 per meter for copper pipe. AC copper pipe is  available on Amazon at Rs. 200 per meter and copper pipe insulation foam is a available on Amazon for Rs. 100 per meter. So total cost on Amazon is Rs. 300 per meter. Just way too expensive pricing by installation team for copper pipe. They charged me Rs. 4500 for 4.5 meter pipe and Rs. 7046 overall for installation. Don't know if this is standard rate of copper pipe from LG or if the local installer is overcharging. Please source copper pipe locally or on Amazon instead of buying from installation team. They also put some white tape on the insulatiom foam, and charged Rs. 440 for it, which is not needed. Save your money. Hope this helps.","helpful":null},{"username":"Ashwani Gupta","rating":"1.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Worst AC..Don't go for it","country":"India","date":"2022-06-11 00:00:00","design":"Style name: Convertible 6 in 1 + 2022","verified":"Verified Purchase","description":"LG selling defected ACs..I bought it in April 2022 and after a month CH 41 error start coming intermittently.LG engineer even don't know what is this error.After this error AC stops and then we have to restart manually.Looks LG selling defected product without any quality check.So it is my advise to other who want to buy LG product.Don't go for LG product and this costly AC.","helpful":null},{"username":"Bhawani singh","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Energy efficiency and cooling is great","country":"India","date":"2022-06-11 00:00:00","design":"Style name: Convertible 6 in 1 + 2022","verified":"Verified Purchase","description":"pros: 1 cooling awsome","helpful":null},{"username":"Rahul singh","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"NYC ac ,, is working well and have great cooling..gud features","country":"India","date":"2022-06-11 00:00:00","design":"Style name: Convertible 6 in 1 + 2022","verified":"Verified Purchase","description":"Super efficient ac with good look","helpful":null},{"username":"Rohit K.","rating":"5.0 out of 5 stars","title":"Nice performance.

But too much for us, because the outdoor unit can be placed right behind the room in the Balcony. And the technician couldn't do the basic connection with the wire for power. Had to call Electrician for that, he just joined the wire and charged 300 bucks :/. And the way of installation was not professional at all as they promote. They left all the packaging as it is, the sand and cement from drilling and plastering around the pipe has not been done. Why the hell do they charge so much the work isn't worth that much. The LG service is way too bad. All show and promotion about service, but nothing much in reality.

I denied and I called Amazon customer care they said no need to pay for removing. She (Amazon) even said it is not their issue, LG customer care is also not informed me about removing charges. Since I denied, the installation guy abused my family and cursed while leaving. He shouted on us. Why should we take these all? This is so hurting. My father tried arguing then that he will not give.

Blue star offers 10 years of compressor warranty for this inverter ac, which very few brands provide. This ac is very powerful on turbo mode. Very energy efficient, 520 units per year is mentioned for its 3 star rating and no other ac provides this much low consumption even in 0.8 ton capacity. If u run it on eco mode it comes very low electricity usage, equal to cooler. The noise level is perfect, it does not make much noise. You can peacefully sleep. The remote is not that great because it does not have led display in it. So you might face issues in night while using it or changing temps. Overall a very good ac, lowest power consumption and good cooling at good price. I bought this ac 1 year ago and no issues at all and i bought it at 24k discounted price. One of the best ac’s available in market today. You can make it a smart ac by using a syska wifi plug with it. I use syska plus and i am controlling my ac through my mobile phone, it shows me power consumption, which i am monitoringbsince last year and really very low consumption it i compare to other ac’s installed in my house. Definitely go for this one without any doubts. Long life of 10 years, all the parts made of copper unlike other brands whole offer aluminum and great cooling!
