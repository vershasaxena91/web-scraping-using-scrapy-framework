So, better stay away from LG refrigerator. After 4 months, there was another fault in the grill circuit and LG technician said to replace the entire grill unit.

So I called and raised my doubt to Customer Care of Amazon, and they confirmed that I can check and then I can accept the product, and if I found any dent or any other issue I can refuse to accept the product. So I checked every corner from top to bottom and I was lucky not to receive any damaged product. Now the product is good, really good. Although it is not super silent, but it is not loud either. Every other reviewer covers every Pros and Cons, I just want to add 1 point which is, if you are looking for a refrigerator which you can lock the door from your little monster in your home then this is not your product. But if you need a good refrigerator with a big Brand name, useful features then certainly you can trust Samsung and Amazon duo.

I lost piece of mind after buying this refrigerator. Unfortunately I did not check this during the first 10 days otherwise I would have returned this. Water becomes ice even if I switch off the freezer so raised an issue with customer support. First one technician has visited and told PCB has some issue and he replaced it. I found the same issue again so called customer care again. Another senior technical visited the place and told his diagnostic device is having problem after connecting to the refrigerator and he told he will get another device and left the place. From then I called customer support hundreds of times and they always responded saying technical person tried reaching you and your phone is not reachable. I got the same reply for morethan 10 days when I contacted support. One days finally after many escalations they sent a senior technician and this time the technician told this is how the refrigerator works and there is no issue with the refrigerator. I am totally confused with his statement because the demo person and other two technicians told me that it shouldn't work this way. But the 4th guy told me this is how it works and any thing you keep in freezer area it becomes ice no matter what option you select. This is totally opposite to convertible mechanism. So Samsung is cheating customers by selling non convertible refrigerator.
