As a result, the detergent used for a top load washing machine needs to be more concentrated. Syclone Matic’s high efficiency quick action formulation is capable of efficiently cleaning clothes in top load machines.","product_details":{"Product Dimensions                                                                                                                ":"15 x 13 x 20 cm; 2 Kilograms","Date First Available                                                                                                                ":"5 November 2018","Manufacturer                                                                                                                ":"Safechem Industries, Safechem Industries Godown No. 29, 88F BT Road, Agarpara Jute Mills Complex, Kolkata, WB, IN, 700058 Contact: 033-2248-9498","ASIN                                                                                                                ":"B07K7NDKK5","Item model number                                                                                                                ":"Syclone Matic Top Load 2kg HPC","Country of Origin                                                                                                                ":"India","Packer                                                                                                                ":"Safechem Industries Godown No. 29, 88F BT Road, Agarpara Jute Mills Complex, Kolkata, WB, IN, 700058 Contact: 033-2248-9498","Item Weight                                                                                                                ":"2 kg","Item Dimensions LxWxH                                                                                                                ":"15 x 13 x 20 Centimeters","Net Quantity                                                                                                                ":"2000.0 gram","Included Components                                                                                                                ":"2N Matic Top Load Detergent Powder with Spoon","Generic Name                                                                                                                ":"Matic Top Load Detergent Powder","Best Sellers Rank":"#2,491 in Health & Personal Care  (See Top 100 in Health & Personal Care) #47 in Powder Detergent","Customer Reviews":"4.1 out of 5 stars 3,448 ratings"},"product_fullfilled":"Fulfilled","product_icons":["Free Delivery","Pay on Delivery","Non-Returnable","Amazon Delivered","Pay on Delivery","Non-Returnable","Amazon Delivered"],"product_important_information":"NA","product_name":"Syclone Matic Top Load Detergent Powder for Washing Machine, 2kg","product_offers":"3","product_original_price":"500.00","product_rating":"4.1 out of 5 stars","product_sale_price":"361.90","product_subscription_discount":"28%","product_total_reviews":"3,448 ratings","product_variations":[]}

We understand that washing clothes and removing stains can be extremely tiring and cumbersome. Especially if you are a mother of a young kid who fills your laundry basket with clothes covered in an array of stains, grass stains from football practice, ketchup stains from lunch and paint stains from art class. Until now you would have to soak your child’s dirty clothes for a couple of hours and then scrub them with your hands using a brush and a bar, and wondered why it takes so much time and effort to remove stains from your kid’s clothes? The answer is because regular detergents do not dissolve completely and don’t work as effectively. Surf excel Easy Wash is a superfine powder that removes tough stains in a jiffy and leaves no residue on your clothes. Being a superfine and fluffy powder it dissolves easily and reaches the stain and removes it easily. Its engineered formula with a superior technology unleashes the power of 10 Hands that is effective in removing toughest of the stains such as mud, ink, oil, ketchup, curry stain and chocolate very easily.","product_details":{"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer                                                                                                                ":"No","Product Dimensions                                                                                                                ":"23 x 2 x 34 cm; 1.5 Kilograms","Date First Available                                                                                                                ":"1 January 2017","Manufacturer                                                                                                                ":"HUL, 1.

Especially if you are a mother of a young kid who fills your laundry basket with clothes covered in an array of stains, grass stains from football practice, ketchup stains from lunch and paint stains from art class. Until now you would have to soak your child’s dirty clothes for a couple of hours and then scrub them with your hands using a brush and a bar, and wondered why it takes so much time and effort to remove stains from your kid’s clothes? The answer is because regular detergents do not dissolve completely and don’t work as effectively. Surf excel Easy Wash is a superfine powder that removes tough stains in a jiffy and leaves no residue on your clothes. Being a superfine and fluffy powder it dissolves easily and reaches the stain and removes it easily. Its engineered formula with a superior technology unleashes the power of 10 Hands that is effective in removing toughest of the stains such as mud, ink, oil, ketchup, curry stain and chocolate very easily.","product_details":{"Is Discontinued By Manufacturer                                                                                                                ":"No","Product Dimensions                                                                                                                ":"33.5 x 1.5 x 38.5 cm; 3 Kilograms","Date First Available                                                                                                                ":"1 January 2017","Manufacturer                                                                                                                ":"HUL, 1.
