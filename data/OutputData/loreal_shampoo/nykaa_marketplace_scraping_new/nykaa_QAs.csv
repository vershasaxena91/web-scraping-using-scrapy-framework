This shampoo has hair-loving key ingredients like neem bhringraj reetha and kelp which promote healthy hair growth. 

Quick Tip: A shampoo's primary function is to cleanse your hair. Even though this shampoo has naturally nourishing ingredients it does not stay on your hair for a long time and hence would not majorly affect the health of your hair. For healthy hair growth hair care methods which stay longer on your hair are recommended - like hair masks and oil treatments.

You can try the Head & Shoulders Smooth & Silky Shampoo available here: <a href=http://www.nykaa.com/head-shoulders-smooth-silky-shampoo.html>http://www.nykaa.com/head-shoulders-smooth-silky-shampoo.html</a> 
You can't change the colour of your greys back to black. However you can experiment with hair colour. Hope you've found the solution to your advantage.
