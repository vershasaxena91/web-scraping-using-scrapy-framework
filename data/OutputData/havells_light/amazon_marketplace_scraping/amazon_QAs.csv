B0862GS4T8,How to get warranty on this bulb,"Ask Amazon customer care, when you get trouble. I had purchased one Philips inverter bulb with nice Carton packing. The inverter bulb was upto my thinking. Second one ordered, the same Philips Inverter bulb. The packing was worst, in a simple brown cover, the consequence was the cover of the bulb has come out & being an engineer assembled myself & used. Informed Amazon on such a worst packing on my second order. Informed Amazon, no reply from them. Ofcourse We can't expect for every item Amazon responsible. Both are Amazon certified source. Hope the second source they should have black listed due to bad packing remark, I suppose in the absence of reply to me. Don't expect any warranty help or bad packing help from Amazon.

It takes care of power supply. Only thing what I found was for balanced power supply failure, working is smooth. For unbalanced power supply failure, function is not that good, means it won't light up on Switched OFF to ON condition. This is due to some current in neutral line. This is common in India ie, unbalanced mode in power failure at times. We can't help. Such condition occurs, switch off main, bulb will work. Then restore main, when supply returns. Findings from super senior citizen engineersee less",0,26-07-2022
B0862GS4T8,What mean the recharge cycle,Recharge cycle means charge / discharge cycle. I think they have given around 10000 cycle or more if I am correct. That's the quality test. It does not mean that it will fail. It is a result of sample test by supplier. Super senior citizen opinion,0,26-07-2022
B0862GS4T8,This bulb is giving light(ON) even when switch is turned down. Is there a way to exchange this?,"Once charged, use like a normal bulb. But daily you switch ON for a some minimum duration to get keep go on the benefit. That's why you should in places like kitchen or dining hall or Drawing hall where usage is there. If you want the bulb in other places, remove the charged bulb & used it wherever you want. Amazon is selling a holder special type, wherein the charged bulb can be plugged & without any wiring you can switch On the bulb with the knob provided on the special holder. It costs only Rs 69/-. I want to order. But Amazon try to levy delivery charges inspite of order value is more than Rs 500. Sad part from Amazon. This special holder is boon to inverter bulb for moveable wirless mode.
